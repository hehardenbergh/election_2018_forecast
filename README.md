# election_2018_forecast

Here is my forecast. Colorado will go blue for the State Senate, but it is likely that the Senate will keep the Senate overall. The chances are high that for each candidate in the 35 Senate elections taking place in 2018, Republicans will maintain majority power over the Senate due to the fact that not many seats are being turned over. Based on FiveThirtyEight's specific data visualization on predictions for both the House and Senate, there is an 83.3% chance that Republicans keep control.

It is very unlikely that the Dems will lose the House.
